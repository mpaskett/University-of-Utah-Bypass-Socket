# University-of-Utah-Bypass-Socket
The University of Utahâ€™s bypass socket is a powerful tool enabling non-amputees to perform functional tasks with upper-limb prosthetic devices. Utilizing modular 3D-printed components, the bypass socket can be easily adapted to virtually any prosthetic device. We hope the bypass socket can become a useful resource to researchers, clinicians, educators, and insurers in the upper-limb prosthetics field.
